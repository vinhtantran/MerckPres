	abstract = {The necessity of pyloroplasty after esophagectomy and gastric pull-up is debated. Disadvantages of a standard pyloroplasty include the potential for leak, shortening of the length of the graft, and complexity when done during a minimally invasive procedure. The aim of this study is to report our experience with a novel internal pyloroplasty technique using a circular stapler (CS pyloroplasty), which is applicable for both laparoscopic and open esophagectomy. The records of all patients who underwent an esophagectomy with gastric pull-up and pyloroplasty between 2002 and 2007 were reviewed. The CS pyloroplasty was performed through a lesser curve gastrotomy with a 21-mm CS, while the standard pyloroplasty entailed a longitudinal full thickness incision through the pylorus with mucosal closure in the same direction and a Graham patch. A CS pyloroplasty was performed in 144 and a standard pyloroplasty in 133 patients. The median patient age was 66years, and the median follow-up was 17months, and was similar for both types of pyloroplasty. Routine postoperative videoesophagram was significantly more likely to show a delay in contrast transit through the pylorus after standard pyloroplasty (16{\%} standard vs. 8{\%} CS pyloroplasty, P= 0.03). Significantly more patients had postoperative endoscopy after standard pyloroplasty (40{\%} standard vs. 24{\%} CS pyloroplasty, P= 0.004), but the frequency of pyloric dilatation was similar. There were no leaks with either technique. A circular stapled pyloroplasty is as efficacious as a standard pyloroplasty after esophagectomy with gastric pull-up. Potential advantages include the ease and simplicity of the procedure along with virtually no risk of a leak and no graft shortening. The technique is amenable to both open and minimally invasive procedures.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The application of conventional statistical methods to directional data generally produces erroneous results. Various regression models for a circular response have been presented in the literature, however these are unsatisfactory either in the limited relationships that can be modeled, or the limitations on the number or type of covariates admissible. One difficulty with circular regression is devising a meaningful regression function. This problem is exacerbated when trying to incorporate both linear and circular variables as covariates. Due to these complexities, circular regression is ripe for exploration via tree-based methods, in which a formal regression function is not needed, but where insight into the general structure and relationship between predictors and the response may be obtained. A basic framework for regression trees, predicting a circular response from a combination of circular and linear predictors, will be presented.},

The reason for this is that the squared difference is not an appropriate measure of distance on the circle.

An alternative maximum-likelihood formulation yields the same regression parameter estimates. Under the maximum-likelihood model, asymptotic standard errors of the parameter estimates are obtained. As an example, the regression model is used to model data from a marine biology study.},

	abstract = {In a previous paper [1] the use of the concept of fuzzy sets in clustering was proposed. The convenience of fuzzy clustering over conventional representation was then stressed. Assigning each point a degree of belongingness to each cluster provides a way of characterizing bridges, strays, and undetermined points. This is especially useful when considering scattered data. The classificatory process may be considered as the breakdown of the probability density function of the original set into the weighted sum of the component fuzzy set densities. Such decomposition should be performed so that the components really represent clusters. This is done by optimization of some functional defined over all possible fuzzy classifications of the data set. Several functionals were suggested in [1]. The bulk of this paper is concerned with numerical techniques useful in the solution of such problems. The first two formulas treated do not provide an acceptable fuzzy classification but yield good starting points for the minimization of a third functional. This last method obtains very good dichotomies and is characterized by slower convergence than the previous processes. Using that functional, a modification is suggested to obtain partitions in more than two sets. Numerous computational experiments are presented.},

A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek etal. (1951a), is constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by applying the criterion of minimum within cluster sum of squares. This procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits. The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a"variance ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points.

Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures.

    abstract = {We studied patterns and mechanisms controlling wind-driven flux of soils and associated organic matter in Taylor Valley, Antarctica over a 10-year period using passive aeolian traps and dynamic mass erosion particle counters. Deployment of the particle counters near meteorological stations allowed us to compare the magnitude of soil flux with data on prevailing wind. Particulate organic C, N and P measurements on transported sediment allowed us to examine connectivity of wind dispersed organic matter among landscape units.Most sediment entrainment occurred within 20cm of the soil surface during "saltation bursts" that occupied {\textless}3{\%} of the total time within a year. These bursts corresponded to periods of strong f{\"{o}}hn winds where wind velocities were≥20ms-1. Sediment movement was highest in the up-valley reaches of Taylor Valley and transport was down-valley towards McMurdo Sound. The general paucity of biological organic matter production throughout the McMurdo Dry Valleys, in concert with low fluvial transport, makes aeolian distribution or organic C, N and P an important factor in the distribution of organic matter throughout this polar desert ecosystem and increases connectivity among the ecosystem components. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The methods build on previous work on clustering of functions, such as Tarpey and Kinateder (2003) and Hitchcock et al. (2007), but explore functions generated from an additive model decomposition (Wood, 2006) of the original time series. Our decomposition targets two aspects of the series, using an adaptive smoother for the trend and circular spline for the diurnal variation in the series. Different measures for comparing locations are discussed, including a method for efficiently clustering time series that are of different lengths using a functional data approach. The complicated nature of these wetlands are highlighted by the shifting group memberships depending on which scale of variation and year of the study are considered.},

This ice loss is best viewed as a combination of strong natural variability in the coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere system and a growing radiative forcing associated with rising concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the latter supported by evidence of qualitative consistency between observed trends and those simulated by climate models over the same period. Although the large scatter between individual model simulations leads to much uncertainty as to when a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean might be realized, this transition to a new arctic state may be rapid once the ice thins to a more vulnerable state. Loss of the ice cover is expected to affect the Arctic's freshwater system and surface energy budget and could be manifested in middle latitudes as altered patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation.},

Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from cOrrespond-ing partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addi-tion to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between -4-I.},

    abstract = {AbstractThe foehn effect is well known as the warming, drying, and cloud clearance experienced on the lee side of mountain ranges during “flow over” conditions. Foehn flows were first described more than a century ago when two mechanisms for this warming effect were postulated: an isentropic drawdown mechanism, where potentially warmer air from aloft is brought down adiabatically, and a latent heating and precipitation mechanism, where air cools less on ascent—owing to condensation and latent heat release—than on its dry descent on the lee side. Here, for the first time, the direct quantitative contribution of these and other foehn warming mechanisms is shown. The results suggest a new paradigm is required after it is demonstrated that a third mechanism, mechanical mixing of the foehn flow by turbulence, is significant. In fact, depending on the flow dynamics, any of the three warming mechanisms can dominate. A novel Lagrangian heat budget model, back trajectories, high-resolution numerical model output, ...},

    abstract = {Online auctions have become increasingly popular in recent years, and as a consequence there is a growing body of empirical research on this topic. Most of that research treats data from online auctions as cross-sectional, and consequently ignores the changing dynamics that occur during an auction. In this article we take a different look at online auctions and propose to study an auction's price evolution and associated price dynamics. Specifically, we develop a dynamic forecasting system to predict the price of an ongoing auction. By dynamic, we mean that the model can predict the price of an auction "in progress" and can update its prediction based on newly arriving information. Forecasting price in online auctions is challenging because traditional forecasting methods cannot adequately account for two features of online auction data: (1) the unequal spacing of bids and (2) the changing dynamics of price and bidding throughout the auction. Our dynamic forecasting model accounts for these special features by using modern functional data analysis techniques. Specifically, we estimate an auction's price velocity and acceleration and use these dynamics, together with other auction-related information, to develop a dynamic functional forecasting model. We also use the functional context to systematically describe the empirical regularities of auction dynamics. We apply our method to a novel set of Harry Potter and Microsoft Xbox data and show that our forecasting model outperforms traditional methods.},

One might expect that the true underlying clusters present in the data differ only with respect to a small fraction of the features, and will be missed if one clusters the observations using the full set of features. We propose a novel framework for sparse clustering, in which one clusters the observations using an adaptively chosen subset of the features. The method uses a lasso-type penalty to select the features. We use this framework to develop simple methods for sparse K-means and sparse hierarchical clustering. A single criterion governs both the selection of the features and the resulting clusters. These approaches are demonstrated on simulated data and on genomic data sets.},

To estimate the spatial distribution and total volume of SWE over mountainous basins, previous work has either assumed uniform snow density or used simple approaches to estimate density. This study uses over 1000 direct measurements of SWE and snow depth (from which density was calculated) in sampling areas that were physiographically proportional to a large (207 km2) mountainous basin in southwest Montana. Using these data, modeled spatial distributions of density and depth were developed and combined to obtain estimates of total basin SWE. Six estimates of SWE were obtained using varying combinations of the distributed depth and density models and were compared to the average of three different models that utilized direct measurements of SWE. Models utilizing direct SWE measurements varied by approximately 1{\%} around their mean, while SWE estimates derived from combined depth and density models varied by over 14{\%} around the same mean. This study highlights the need to carefully consider the spatial variability of density when estimating SWE based on snow depth in these environments.},

    abstract = {This research monograph provides a synthesis of a number of statistical tests and measures, which, at first consideration, appear disjoint and unrelated. Numerous comparisons of permutation and classical statistical methods are presented, and the two methods are compared via probability values and, where appropriate, measures of effect size. Permutation statistical methods, compared to classical statistical methods, do not rely on theoretical distributions, avoid the usual assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance, and depend only on the data at hand. This text takes a unique approach to explaining statistics by integrating a large variety of statistical methods, and establishing the rigor of a topic that to many may seem to be a nascent field in statistics. This topic is new in that it took modern computing power to make permutation methods available to people working in the mainstream of research. This research monograph addresses a statistically-informed audience, and can also easily serve as a textbook in a graduate course in departments such as statistics, psychology, or biology. In particular, the audience for the book is teachers of statistics, practicing statisticians, applied statisticians, and quantitative graduate students in fields such as psychology, medical research, epidemiology, public health, and biology.

Clustering results can differ depending on how the curves are fit to the data. Estimating curves using different sets of basis functions corresponds to different linear transformations of the data. k-means clustering is not invariant to linear transformations of the data. The optimal linear transformation for clustering will stretch the distribution so that the primary direction of variability aligns with actual differences in the clusters. It is shown that clustering the raw data will often give results similar to clustering regression coefficients obtained using an orthogonal design matrix. Clustering functional data using an L 2 metric on function space can be achieved by clustering a suitable linear transformation of the regression coefficients. An example where depressed individuals are treated with an antidepressant is used for illustration.},

    abstract = {K-means is undoubtedly the most widely used partitional clustering algorithm. Unfortunately, due to its gradient descent nature, this algorithm is highly sensitive to the initial placement of the cluster centers. Numerous initialization methods have been proposed to address this problem. In this paper, we first present an overview of these methods with an emphasis on their computational efficiency. We then compare eight commonly used linear time complexity initialization methods on a large and diverse collection of data sets using various performance criteria. Finally, we analyze the experimental results using non-parametric statistical tests and provide recommendations for practitioners. We demonstrate that popular initialization methods often perform poorly and that there are in fact strong alternatives to these methods.},

But many data sets have more than two variables, or they come in the form of inter-object dissimilarities. There exist methods to partition such a data set into clusters, but the resulting partition is not visual by itself. In this paper we construct a new graphical display called CLUSPLOT, in which the objects are represented as points in a bivariate plot and the clusters as ellipses of various sizes and shapes. The algorithm is implemented as an S-PLUS function. Several options are available, e.g. labelling of objects and clusters, drawing lines connecting clusters, and the use of color. We illustrate this new tool with several examples.},

A simulation study compares the accuracy of clustering results on the basis of the use of unsmoothed functional data—and two smoothed versions of the data—as the inputs in a clustering algorithm.

Two real functional data sets are clustered using the competing methods to illustrate the procedure.},

    abstract = {It is well known that most of the common clustering objectives are NP-hard to optimize. In practice, however, clustering is being routinely carried out. One approach for providing theoretical understanding of this seeming discrepancy is to come up with notions of clusterability that distinguish realistically interesting input data from worst-case data sets. The hope is that there will be clustering algorithms that are provably efficient on such 'clusterable' instances. In other words, hope that "Clustering is difficult only when it does not matter" (CDNM thesis, for short). We believe that to some extent this may indeed be the case. This paper provides a survey of recent papers along this line of research and a critical evaluation their results. Our bottom line conclusion is that that CDNM thesis is still far from being formally substantiated. We start by discussing which requirements should be met in order to provide formal support the validity of the CDNM thesis. In particular, we list some implied requirements for notions of clusterability. We then examine existing results in view of those requirements and outline some research challenges and open questions.},

    abstract = {OBJECTIVE Biomarkers aid diagnosis, allow inexpensive screening of therapies and guide selection of patient-specific therapeutic regimens in most internal medicine disciplines. In contrast, neurology lacks validated measurements of the physiological status, or dysfunction(s) of cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Accordingly, patients with chronic neurological diseases are often treated with a single disease-modifying therapy without understanding patient-specific drivers of disability. Therefore, using multiple sclerosis (MS) as an example of a complex polygenic neurological disease, we sought to determine if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are intra-individually stable, cell type-, disease- and/or process-specific and responsive to therapeutic intervention. METHODS We used statistical learning in a modeling cohort (n=225) to develop diagnostic classifiers from DNA-aptamer-based measurements of 1128 CSF proteins. An independent validation cohort (n=85) assessed the reliability of derived classifiers. The biological interpretation resulted from in-vitro modeling of primary or stem cell-derived human CNS cells and cell lines. RESULTS The classifier that differentiates MS from CNS diseases that mimic MS clinically, pathophysiologically and on imaging, achieved a validated area under receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.98, while the classifier that differentiates relapsing-remitting from progressive MS achieved a validated AUROC of 0.91. No classifiers could differentiate primary- from secondary-progressive MS better than random guessing. Treatment-induced changes in biomarkers greatly exceeded intra-individual- and technical variabilities of the assay. INTERPRETATION CNS biological processes reflected by CSF biomarkers are robust, stable, and disease- or even disease-stage specific. This opens opportunities for broad utilization of CSF biomarkers in drug development and precision medicine for CNS disorders. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},
